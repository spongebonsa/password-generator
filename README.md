Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

Choose the character types you want to include in your password (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters) by checking the corresponding checkboxes.

Click the "Generate Password" button to create your password.

Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy your password to your clipboard.


How It Works

The password generator uses JavaScript to randomly select characters from a set of character arrays based on the user's selected options. It then concatenates the selected characters into a string and displays the generated password on the page. 


The "Copy to Clipboard" functionality uses the document.execCommand("copy") method to copy the generated password to the user's clipboard.
